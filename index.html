    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    <p>Hello world, this is my second website so far. I hope it will come out well. My very first time to create a website was when we were learning about HTML.</p>
    <P>This time round we have covered CSS and Javascript. I have gained more experience than the first time i was doing this. I'm not yet superb in this but as time 
        goes by i believe i'll be somewhere.</P>
    <p>I have hope that this will be great.</p>
    <h2>My wish</h2>
    <p>My wish is to be able to create something without any difficulties.</p>
    <p>I just wish for the best during this journey. Catching up with the speed and beeing able to understand every bit of topic there is.</p>
    <p>I study alongside my intresting classmates. They are so kind and cooperative. Sometimes i wonder how they manage to be this good.</p>

      love this place.</p>
